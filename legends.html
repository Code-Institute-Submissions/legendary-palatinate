                <p> Nestled in the heart of Germany's Palatinate Forest, our hunting club hails back to Roman times.
                    Rich in tradition, this is a place where reverence for the wilderness intertwines with the thrill of
                    the chase. The Roman emperors chose our majestic landscapes as their hunting grounds, establishing
                    an annual hunting event that became a testament to courage, skill, and endurance. This event, held
                    in the magical midsummer, has become a rite of passage that has lasted for centuries.
                    Today, the Association is a beacon of camaraderie, a community of individuals bound by a shared love
                    for the wilderness and the excitement of the hunt. We value honor, bravery, and respect for the
                    natural
                    world. Join us, and inscribe your name into the annals of our enduring legacy.

                <p>Throughout the ages, our hunting club has been shrouded in mystery, its tales and traditions passed
                    down orally through generations. One such account is a passage from Julius Caesar's 'De Bello
                    Gallico', written around 58-49 BC. :</p>

                                atque ita paulum modo reclinatae quietem capiunt.

                                conspexerunt

                            <p>25. [...] It is certain that many kinds of wild beast are produced in this forest which
                                have
                                not been seen in other parts; of which the following are such as differ principally from
                                other
                                animals, and appear worthy of being committed to record.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>27. There are also animals which are called elcs. The shape of these, and the varied
                                color of their skins, is much like roes, but in size they surpass them a little and are
                                destitute of horns, and have legs without joints and ligatures; nor do they lie down for
                                the purpose of rest, nor, if they have been thrown down by any accident, can they raise
                                or lift themselves up.
                                Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only
                                slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps of
                                these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine
                                all the trees at the roots, or cut into them so far that the upper part of the trees may
                                appear to be left standing.
                                When they have leant upon them, according to their habit, they knock down by their
                                weight the unsupported trees, and fall down themselves along with them.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>28. [...] Their strength and speed are extraordinary; they spare neither man nor wild
                                beast which they have espied. These the Germans take with much pains in pits and kill
                                them. The young men harden themselves with this exercise, and practice themselves in
                                this kind of hunting, and those who have slain the greatest number of them, having
                                produced the horns in public, to serve as evidence, receive great praise. But not even
                                when taken very young can they be rendered familiar to men and tamed. The size, shape,
                                and appearance of their horns differ much from the horns of our oxen. These they
                                anxiously seek after, and bind at the tips with silver, and use as cups at their most
                                sumptuous entertainments.
