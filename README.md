# Legendary Palatinate - a Journey through the Untold Legends of the Palatinate Forest

Welcome to Palatinate Hunting, a web project designed to immerse users in the enchanting mysteries and legends of the Palatinate Forest. My project aims to bring to life the rich folklore and captivating narratives surrounding this ancient woodland.

Discover the untold stories of mythical creatures, led by the legendary Eletrische, a majestic and elusive being that captures the imagination of hunters and nature enthusiasts alike.

## Features

### Navigation bar

Featured on all HTML pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes the logo which links to the top of the main page (rather than reloading the page for a better user experience) and a link to each section within the main page. This allows the user to easily navigate to their desired section without having to use the "back" button each time.
When hovered over, the colour of all links changes from green to violette, which enables the user to see which link they are selecting.

### The landing page image (hero-image)

The Hero-image is a photography taken from Wikipedia. It is a panorama view over the palatinate forest with a ruin of a castle.

### Site Goals and Initial Concept

The initial concept of Legendary Palatinate is to create a touristic website that emulates a real hunting club, aiming to attract tourists to the enchanting Palatinate Forest region. The website aims to provide an immersive experience, offering visitors the opportunity to explore the untold legends of the forest, learn about the mythical Elwetrisch creature, and be inspired to participate in hunting events. As the project evolves, it has the potential to become an information portal for the rich history, cultural events, hotels, and restaurants of the region, showcasing its ancient castles and ruins dating back to the Celts and Romans. By blending captivating storytelling, educational content, and interactive features, the website seeks to engage visitors and ignite their curiosity about the beauty of the Palatinate Forest.

### Colors

The design of Legendary Palatinate draws inspiration from the hero image, capturing the serene blue of the sky for the background color. This evokes calm and tranquility, complementing the lush greenery of the Palatinate Forest. The text color resembles old ink and wood, adding a touch of nostalgia. Links feature a saturated green, harmonizing with the forest and reinforcing the project's theme. A hover-over effect applies a stronger complement color, a saturated violet, for interactivity. This design aims to create an immersive and visually captivating experience

### Fonts

There are three fonts used in the website and they are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- _UnifrakturMaguntia_ - Only used for the page-titles. It gives the site a sense of old European history and folklore.
- _Cormorant Infant_ - Applied for introductory text and headings, to ensure readability while maintaing the historical feel of UnifrakturMaguntia.
- _Pridi_ - Used for body text, as a legible contrast, providing a balance between decorative and functional elements.

### Wireframes

I prefer a traditional approach to wireframing, starting with the simplicity of pen and paper to sketch out my initial ideas. Once I have a basic outline, I utilize Inkscape, a powerful vector graphics editor, to refine and add details to my wireframes.
