I used [Fontjoy](https://fontjoy.com/) to find suitable pairings of Google-Fonts.

- _UnifrakturMaguntia_ - only for the page-titles. It gives the site a sense of old European history and folklore.
- _Cormorant Infant_ for introductory text and headings, to ensure readability while maintaing the historical feel of UnifrakturMaguntia.
- _Pridi_ - for body text, as a legible contrast, providing a balance between decorative and functional elements.
