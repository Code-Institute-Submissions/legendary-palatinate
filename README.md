## Features

### List of Existing Features

#### Navigation bar

Featured on all HTML pages, the fully responsive navigation bar includes the logo which links to the top of the main page (rather than reloading the page for a better user experience) and a link to each section within the main page. This allows the user to easily navigate to their desired section without having to use the "back" button each time.
When hovered over, the colour of all links changes from green to violette, which enables the user to see which link they are selecting.

#### The landing page image (hero-image)

is a photography taken from Wikipedia. It is a panorama view over the palatinate forest with a ruin of a castle.

#### The Source Text

On the legends-page is an excerpt of Julius Caesars famous book about the Gallic War. The original Latin text is set side by side with the English translation. Both are scrollable.

#### The Footer

The footer section includes links to social media sites.

The website consists of three pages:

Background is taken from sky-color of hero-image with the pipette-too from Gimp.
Text color are variants of sepia to resemble old ink and wood.
The link color is a saturated green complement color of the choosen text color, which is also the color of the cover-test background color that hold the headings (Titles) of each page. There is a hover-over effect of thelinks i an even sstronger complement color of that green (a saturated violette).

### Fonts

There are three fonts used in the website and they are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- _UnifrakturMaguntia_ - Only used for the page-titles. It gives the site a sense of old European history and folklore.
- _Cormorant Infant_ - Applied for introductory text and headings, to ensure readability while maintaing the historical feel of UnifrakturMaguntia.
- _Pridi_ - Used for body text, as a legible contrast, providing a balance between decorative and functional elements.
